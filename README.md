Probability Programs
===================

### A small collection of all the probability programs I wrote during my probability class at Cal

To run a Java program on a Mac or a Unix/Linux machine, you must have Java (either JDE or JRE will do) installed. On the terminal, type (for example, the Poisson program)
   
    javac poisson.java
    java poisson

To run a Python program (Python 2.7 will work BEST), for example, on the terminal, type
    
    python sampleDistribution.py

I don't think it will work for Python3 yet since Matplotlib hasn't been officially supported on Python3, but stay tuned!
