Probability Programs
===================

### A small collection of all the probability programs I wrote during my probability class at Cal

Updated with Python3's version :) 

If you have trouble installing matplotlib for Python3, [here's a good place to start](http://joat-programmer.blogspot.com/2012/08/installing-matplotlib-on-python3.html). What I did was, install [distribute](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute) first, then [pip for Py3K](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip), then numpy, and then other matplotlib's dependencies (as seen in the link above). Finally, clone [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) to your local directory, and compile from sources. 

If there are multiple versions of pip, don't forget to specify **pip-3.2** (or 3.3).
